# If you wonder what this should do

## If you want to know how I proceeded in this project

Whole project is in typescript - apart from [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) E2E tests; these uses pure js. I've taken the Inspiration for user cards from [ui design](https://uidesigndaily.com/posts/photoshop-profile-card-user-day-286). background was generated by [eggradients](https://www.eggradients.com/). Whole project took around 4 hours. Biggest junk of time took styling tweaking. API simulates user responses --

1. ### State management

   I used simple prop passing with callbacks. Example of such doing can be User Card component

2. ### Components and accessibility

   All components are self-made and responsive - apart from loading placeholders during data fetching. I applied techniques that should ensure that this app provides very good results regarding accessibility. During development I used [react-axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe) for most precise guideline following with eslint plugin: [jsx-a11y/recommended](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).

3. ### Styling

   I used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling. I've provided an example of the [theme](https://github.com/DarkEye123/simple-user-cards/blob/homework/src/theme.ts) To improve the power of css-in-js solution, I've decided to re-use some helpful ideas from sass world via package [polished](https://github.com/styled-components/polished)

4. ### Testing & Project Development tweaks

   [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) E2E tests;
   `yarn test:e2e`
   I also uses pre-commit hook doing linting + formatting running via [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky#readme) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

## Available Scripts
